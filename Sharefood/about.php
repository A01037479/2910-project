    <h2 class="about-h2">- Who We Are -</h2>
    <p class="about-desc">We are a team of five, term 1 students enrolled in BCIT's 
    Computer Systems Technology program.  We were inspired by Metro Vancouver to help make a 
    difference in the battle to reduce food waste in our community by educating, raising awareness 
    and creating a behavioural change.
    </p> 
    
    <h2 class="about-h2">- Mission -</h2>
    <p class="about-mission-quote"><i>"To inspire communities to be more conscious about food waste
    by connecting them through food sharing"</i></p>
    <p class="about-desc">We want to seek sustainable solutions 
    for the food waste problem and connect communities together.  We aim to expand
    the sharing economy by offering people a platform to share their excess food and ingredients
    with others in their community.  By doing so, less food will end up in landfills and and more 
    food will end up in our bellies.</p>
